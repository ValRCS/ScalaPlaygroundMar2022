  //when you are learning it is fine to make extra comments
  //one problem with comments is that they can fail to keep up with the code
  //that is the worst
  //comment says one thing
  //code says something else
  //and you are trying to figure out which one is right
  //then version control might help
  //even worse then you realize that it was you who wrote it 6 months ago :)
